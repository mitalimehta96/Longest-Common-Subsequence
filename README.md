# Longest-Common-Subsequence
To find and print longest common subsequence 

What is LCS?

Given 2 sequences X and Y, find a maximum length subsquence Z.

Example:

X = ABCDBAB, Y = BDCABA

A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

Subsequences may be ABA, BCA, BBA, BCBA, BDAB etc.

Here, LCS = BCBA and BDAB
